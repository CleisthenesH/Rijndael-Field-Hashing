General introduction
This is an accompanying document to the repository.

\section{Structure of this Document}
It is meant to approachable to someone that has freshman understand of math or programing,
while possibly requiring some external research to use to the fullest.
And hopefully being giving enough of a taste to inspire that research.

And maybe even an ambassador for abstract algebra and cryptography for people that are interested in those things but need practical applications to make them stick.

There is a bit of a hike to get towards the Rijndael Field and people familiar with abstract algebra can skip the rest of this introduction.
